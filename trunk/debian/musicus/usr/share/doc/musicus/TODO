TODO -- 2007/12/15
===============================

CODES: (cn)
 c = { OPEN, PROBABLY FIXED, FIXED, DISCONTINUED}
 n = running number (00 - 99)

OPEN:
 FUNCTIONAL:
  (000) double-click on applet => playlist window -- does not work,
        even though same code as volume-control applet
  (001) Don't terminate abnormally if mpd service is stopped -- !IMPORTANT! 2007/12/19 probably fixed, no extended tests though. It might also have introduced a new bug concerning manual connect/disconnect from mpd
  (002) Change song order in playlist
  (003) save/load playlists (through mpd)
  (004) Volume Control
  (005) Make lyrics display configurable, as it is still likely to 
        crash the whole applet/program
  (006) Command line flags for disabling fetching lyrics / verbosity
  (007) Don't block too long in fetch_lyrics
  (008) Playlist reordering
  (009) Change playlist display into list instead of tree

 DEBUG/LOG FACILITIES
  (030) ifdef all debug output, so it can be completely disabled at compile
        time, could give performance impact

 CODING

PROBABLY FIXED:
 (100) Media Browser (dep. libmpd) does not work for Applet,
       has sth to do w/ libmpd, mpdobj -- 2007/09/22 -- 2007/10: 
       probably corresponded to (103)
 (101) bugs in media browser (disappearing of window contents) -- 2007/09
 (102) problems with pause timer display (counting too fast in statusbar /
       reset in tooltip) 
 (103) Media Browser does not work with applet, when applet is loaded on
       system start, works when applet is reloaded later on -- 2007/10
       problem was that on my machine mpd started only after networking
       which needed some time to start ( wireless & wpa_supplicant 

FIXED:
 (200) Verbose Applet
 (201) Rearrange Playlist, Search + Media Browser
       into Panes in Playlist window 
 (202) title updater for applet 
 (203) settings (mpd host, port; log level ...) 
 (204) tooltip/status/title format in config 
 (205) create a possibility to reload the media-browser root window. 
 (206) Random/Repeat/Xfade display 
 (207) Possibility to add streams to playlist
 (270) write proper documentation
DISCONTINUED:
 (308) started lyrics fetcher (just works with www.darklyrics.com for now)
 (331) try to build a log window -- not very important right now,
       kicked the code for opening a log window out (2007/12)
